\subsection{Setting up your workspace}

To install \mesa\ on your personal linux or mac computer do the following.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Download and install the appropriate SDK, available from \url{http://www.astro.wisc.edu/~townsend/static.php?ref=mesasdk}. 
	\item Use \code{svn} to checkout the latest release verion of \MESA. Instructions are available from \url{http://mesa.sourceforge.net}.
	\item From a terminal window, go into the top-level \mesa\ directory and execute the following commands: `|./clean; ./install|'.  This may take some time as \mesa\ will be building fairly large datasets for the equation of state and opacity.  If all goes well, you will get a message at the end indicating that \mesa\ installation was successful.
\end{enumerate}

Once you have \mesa\ installed, you then set up your work environment. To do this, you create a project directory and set environment variables so that your \code{FORTRAN} compilers can find the \mesa\ libraries.

\subsection{Running your first MESA project}

You are now ready to compile and run your first \mesa\ project for this course. This is a model of a $\val{1}{\Msun}$ pre-main-sequence star. The code stops when the luminosity from hydrogen fusion first exceeds 0.95 of the luminosity from the surface. 

Download the folder |1M-pms| and place it into your projects folder.

Now execute `|./mk|'. This will call the fortran compiler to build the executable. 

If everything compiles okay, then an executable file called `|star|' will be placed in the directory. To run \mesa, type `|./rn|' at the prompt.  If all goes well, after some time a window should appear with an animated plot looking something like Figure~\ref{f.mesa-fig}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Grid1_00240}
\caption{Graphical output from a \mesa\ run of a $\val{1}{\Msun}$ PMS star. \label{f.mesa-fig}}
\end{figure}

The large plot labeled `|TRho_profile|' shows the run of temperature $T$ versus density $\rho$ in the star, with the various colors indicating mixing and energy generating regions. The small plot labeled `|HR|' traces the history of luminosity $L$, in units of the solar luminosity $\Lsun$, versus effective temperature $\Teff$. The other small plot labeled `|TRho|' traces the history of the central temperature $T_{c}$ versus the central density $\rho_{c}$.

\begin{exercisebox}[Contraction of a star to the main sequence]
\begin{enumerate}
\item How long did the star take to contract to the main sequence?
\item What are $L$, $\Teff$, $T_{c}$, and $\rho_{c}$ when the star begins H burning?
\item Describe how the fraction of the star that is convective changes during the run.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercisebox}

\subsection{A peak under the hood}
To understand what just happened, we start with the command `|./rn|'. This is just a script---you can open it with a text editor---containing the following.
\VerbatimInput{introduction/1M-pms/rn}
This just gets some information about the version of \mesa\ being used (the `|svn info|' directive), removes any pre-existing file with restart information, prints the date, runs star, and then prints the date again.

The command `|star|' is built from the source code in `|src/run.f|'. This is a very short program.  The relevant lines
\VerbatimInput[firstline=11,lastline=16]{introduction/1M-pms/src/run.f}
direct the program to read in parameters from a file `|inlist|' and then hand control to a subroutine, `|do_run_star|', within the \mesa\ library.

The file `|inlist|', is divided into three sections (each section begins with an `|&|' followed by the section name and ends with a `|/|'): `|star_job|', `|controls|', and `|pgstar|'.  The bang `|!|' denotes the start of a comment. This list is rather simple. The first section
\VerbatimInput[firstline=1,lastline=9]{introduction/1M-pms/inlist}
tells \mesa\ to read another file, `|1M_pms.inlist|'. The second section, `|&controls|' also tells \mesa\ to read in `|1M_pms.inlist|'. It is in `|1M_pms.inlist|' that all of the settings are placed, so take a quick peek at that file.  For example, in section `|&star_job|' the lines
\VerbatimInput[firstline=21,lastline=22]{introduction/1M-pms/1M_pms.inlist}
tell \mesa\ to pause and wait for the user to hit `|return|' before ending the code, and to activate the plotting windows. In section `|&controls|' the lines
\VerbatimInput[firstline=31,lastline=32]{introduction/1M-pms/1M_pms.inlist}
tell \mesa\ the initial mass and metallicity of the star, while the lines
\VerbatimInput[firstline=42,lastline=43]{introduction/1M-pms/1M_pms.inlist}
tell \mesa\ to stop when the total power from nuclear burning, $L_{\mathrm{nuc}}$, exceeds $0.95 L$, where $L$ is the total surface luminosity.

The third section of `|inlist|'
\VerbatimInput[firstline=18,lastline=26]{introduction/1M-pms/inlist}
reads in the parameters for the plot from `|basic_plot.inlist|'. There is another parameter file, `|track_scaled_vars.inlist|', but the flag to read that file is 
`|read_extra_pgstar_inlist2 = .false.|'  As you might guess, you'll be using this later on in the assignment.

\begin{center}
\fbox{\parbox{0.96\textwidth}{\textbf{Question:} There is a reason for nesting the parameter inlist files. Can you discern what that reason is?}}
\end{center}

Now that you've seen how the code in action, we are going to look a bit more at the architecture of \mesa. If you do `|ls $MESA_DIR|', you will see that \mesa\ is divided into modules: `|eos|' computes the equation of state, `|kap|' computes the opacity, and so forth. Within each module are two folders, `|public|' and `|private|'.  The `|public|' folder contains the interface of that module. The source file ending with `|_def.f|' contains the data structures used by that module, and the source file ending with `|_lib.f|' contains the routines for that module. The |private| directory contains the inner machinery of the module.

All of these modules can be used by themselves; the `|star|' module puts everything together to simulate stellar evolution. What |star| does is to evolve a stellar model---a complete description of a star at a given instant of time---forward in time by some amount $\Delta t$. String together a sequence of such models and you have a representation of the star's evolution. These models are not evenly spaced in time; rather, \mesa\ adjusts $\Delta t$ to keep the models accurate within specified tolerances. The |star| module contains, in addition to the |public| interface and |private| machinery, additional routines in the folder |job| for starting a run from some initial model and stopping that run when a specified condition is met.

\subsection{A MESA project}

The \mesa\ code that you installed is a library, a collection of routines that when combined simulate the evolution of a stellar-like object. To put everything together, you create a directory, such as `|1M-pms|'.  A template for such a directory is contained in `|$MESA_DIR/star/work|'---consult the `|README|' file there for instructions. 

The working directory is organized into several sub-directories. The `|make|' folder contains the `|makefile|' script for compiling the code. The `|src|' folder contains, in addition to the top-level `|run.f|' code, a collection of customizable routines in the file `|run_star_extras.f|'. In addition to these folders, the working directory contains a set of inlist files; these, as mentioned above, contain all of the parameters necessary to control the \mesa\ run and its output.  The complete listings of parameters and their default settings are contained in the directory `|$MESA_DIR/star/defaults|' in the three files `|*.defaults|'. The inlists in the work directory only need to contain those parameters that differ from the defaults.

The final components of the working directory are sub-directories to hold the output of \mesa.  The names of these are customizable and can be set in the inlists; by default, the main two are called `|LOGS|' and `|photos|'.  Within `|LOGS|' are the file `|history.data|' and the files `|profile|\textit{dd}|.data|'. The `|history.data|' file contains the time evolution of global stellar properties, such as luminosity, radius, surface effective temperature, and so on. The `|profile|\textit{dd}|.data|' files contain ``snapshots'' of the star's structure: the run of temperature, density, pressure, and so on with location within the star. 

\subsection{Exercise: customizing MESA output}

After that brief overview of the \mesa\ architecture, let's do something concrete: we'll customize \mesa\ to have it generate a plot of a variable that we define.  In this chapter, we've argued that the central pressure of a star should scale as $P_{c}\propto GM^{2}/R^{4}$. We also found that the central density should scale as the mean density, $\rho_{c}\propto \bar{\rho} = 3M/(4\pi R^{3})$. Exercise~\ref{ex.central-temperature} asks you to find the central temperature in terms of $M$, $R$, and mean molecular weight $\mu$. What the derivation in the chapter doesn't tell us is the coefficient $\rho_{c}/\bar{\rho}$ and its counterparts for pressure and temperature.  We can use \mesa, however, to test these scalings and extract these constants of proportionality.

To do this, we modify the code in `|src/run_star_extras.f|'.  What we want is for \mesa\ to calculate $P_{\mathrm{scale}} = GM^{2}/R^{4}$, $\rho_{\mathrm{scale}} = \bar{\rho}$, and $T_{\mathrm{scale}}$, and then write out the values of $P_{c}/P_{\mathrm{scale}}$, $\rho_{c}/\rho_{\mathrm{scale}}$, and $T_{c}/T_{\mathrm{scale}}$ in the file `|history.data|'. To do this, we first tell \mesa\ how many extra columns in `|history.data|' we need:
\VerbatimInput[firstline=96,lastline=104,gobble=8]{introduction/1M-pms/src/run_star_extras.f}
Here I am adding one column, which will be $P_{c}/P_{\mathrm{scale}}$.  When you implement the other scalings, you'll change the variable \verb|how_many_extra_history_columns| to reflect that we need three columns.

Next, we need to compute the data for these columns.  We therefore modify the following routine.
\VerbatimInput[firstline=107,lastline=154,gobble=8]{introduction/1M-pms/src/run_star_extras.f}
In detail, we first declare the extra variables we need.
\VerbatimInput[firstline=113,lastline=113,gobble=8]{introduction/1M-pms/src/run_star_extras.f}
Next, we give each column a name.
\VerbatimInput[firstline=124,lastline=126,gobble=8]{introduction/1M-pms/src/run_star_extras.f}
Notice that the latter two are commented out (`|!|'); for this example; you'll need to uncomment them to print out the other variables.

We are then ready to compute our values.  Note that \mesa\ defines many physical constants in `|$MESA_DIR/const/public/const_def.f|'; we therefore use this in line 130 for $G$, and you can read the hint in lines 143ff. Next, we need to get the values of $M$, $R$, $\mu_{c}$, $P_{c}$, $\rho_{c}$, and $T_{c}$. These are provided in a data structure |s|, which the routine fetches
\VerbatimInput[firstline=116,lastline=116,gobble=8]{introduction/1M-pms/src/run_star_extras.f}
from the variable |id| that is passed to the routine.  To see a complete list of what is in this data structure, look at `|$MESA_DIR/star/public/star_data.inc|'. I've already taken care of computing $M$, $R$, $\mu_{c}$, and $P_{\mathrm{scale}}$ for you.  The values of our scaled variables are then stored in the array `|vals|'; you will fill in the second and third members of the array.

If you look in `|LOGS/history.data|', you should see that the last column is indeed `|Pc_scaled|', as expected. Of course, we'd like to display it graphically, and \mesa\ does predefine plots that can display values in `|history.data|'. We customized the output in `|track_scaled_vars.inlist|':
\VerbatimInput{introduction/1M-pms/track_scaled_vars.inlist}
To use this, we activate the window by setting the flag in line 3 to `|.true.|'. If we want to save our output, we set the `|file_flag = .true.|' in line 11.
